### Project goals

The goal of this project was to create an application that would allow users to share recipies from accross the world. The app allows the user to create, read, update and delete their data (CRUD). The app also allows the user to view and leave comments on any uploaded recipe. It provides a platform for all the food lovers out there to share and also try new recipes.
